"Paul's People Projects" is my alliterative assortment of projects that revolve around human behavior. They are a marriage of several interests: behavioral science, art, design, and data journalism. I'm aiming for a fun and engaging way of building connection and understanding between people. Get in touch if you want to collaborate!

    <summary> Motivating questions </summary>

- **Belief vs. Behavior**. What drives the gaps between them? About how to live a good life, one's personal qualities, ? When is that gap useful and not? How do beliefs and behavior reinforce and undermine each other?
- **Motivation**. What balance of short-term vs. long-term desires leads to a maximally satisfying life? What does this balance look like over the course of a day, week, year? When are people *actually* successful at prioritizing long-term over short-term?
- **Awareness**. How accurately do we diagnose what makes us happy? How many of our behaviors do we choose? Are we correct about what most influences our behavior and how we affect others? How can we raise our awareness of all of these things?

## In The Works

### Letter-writing project
Snail mail between me and anyone who bites: my closest friends, distant acquaintances, and random strangers. Turning my daily journal into a daily letter. Meant to be an antidote to the counterintuitive side effects of our constantly-connected world. An experiment in authenticity, vulnerability, and more satisfying communication. Not pen pals per se, but more like sending feelers out into the void and seeing what comes back!  
Will begin once I'm somewhere more settled for at least 6 months. More details to come. 

### Life story project 
A photo album + diary for the modern age. A collaborative way for families and friends to document and share their life stories. Ideally as user-friendly and simple as possible: write some text, upload pics/videos, and invite others to contribute to shared life experiences. Not a social network, just a better tool for future nostalgia and documenting one's life for personal use. I know that in my young life I'm already forgetting many details and moments...  
If you're interested and able, help me! Starting from scratch on learning how to put this together as a web/mobile app so would love input. 

### Similarities surveys (ongoing)
Surveys motivated by my hunches. The focus is more on curiosity than scientific rigor (i.e. not worried about representativeness). I hope to marry the clickbait appeal of Buzzfeed with the deeper reflection of good art.
