"Paul's People Projects" is my alliterative assortment of projects that revolve around human behavior. They are a marriage of several interests: behavioral science, art, design, and communication. I'm aiming for a fun and engaging way of building connection and understanding between people. Get in touch if you want to collaborate!

Some guiding questions:
- Belief vs. Behavior. What drives the gaps between them? About how to live a good life, one's personal qualities, ? When is that gap useful and not? How do beliefs and behavior reinforce and undermine each other?
- Work. What ought to be the role of work in a meaningful life? Are people motivated more by sticks or carrots, by external or internal pressures, under different conditions? As the nature of work continues to change, 
- Motivation. What balance of short-term vs. long-term desires leads to a maximally satisfying life? What does this balance look like over the course of a day, week, year? When are people *actually* successful at prioritizing long-term over short-term?
- Awareness. How accurately do we diagnose what makes us happy? How many of our behaviors do we choose? Are we correct about what most influences our behavior and how we affect others? How can we raise our awareness of all of these things? 


## In The Works

Letter-writing project.

Life story project. 

**Similarities surveys (ongoing)**. Sporadic surveys usually motivated by "I wonder if this is just me or a general truth." The focus is more on curiosity than scientific rigor. I hope to marry the clickbait appeal of Buzzfeed with the deeper reflection of good musical theater.
