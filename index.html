	<h1>Hi there, I'm Paul Nakai Gregg!</h1>
	<p>This site is my stubborn attempt to present an online version of myself that doesn't reduce to my most marketable persona. I am a human being who likes to be paid to do interesting work but refuses the notion that one needs a LinkedIn to live a fullfilling life.</p>
    <p>If you're a potential employer, please look around. The <a href="/resume">Resume</a> tab details my traditional workplace skills, but I deeply believe that my value add comes from my whole person, not just my resume-permissible abilities.
    <p>If you're someone besides a potential employer: hi, mom.</p>
