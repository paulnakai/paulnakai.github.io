        <p>About me: I grew up in Waimea, Hawaii, went to college in the Bay Area, and am now in my semi-nomadic twenties. I greatly enjoy board games, reading, making music, puns and general silliness, and everything that happens outside.</p>
        <p>About this site: rather than a traditional portfolio website, this site is designed to round out the picture of who I am. I believe you will more likely find what you're looking for—whether you are a potential employer, collaborator, or friend—from this balanced impression of my thoughts, hobbies, and interests than a purely professional alternative. It's also just fun.</p>
