        <p>I grew up in Kamuela, Hawaii, went to college in Bay Area California, and have yet to be convinced to move somewhere with real winter. I greatly enjoy board games, reading, making music, puns and general silliness, and everything that happens outside.</p>
        <p>I tend to think, write, and talk about issues related to economic justice, socioemotional health, education, ethics, the future of work, humanism, authenticity, intentionality. I'd like to call myself a <b>"behavioral artist"</b> (but am resistant to the notion of personal branding). I think behavioral science is a fascinating framework for finding interesting questions to ask about the world, but art, storytelling, and clarified communication is the key to bringing us all forward, together.</p>
        <p>Some guiding questions for me: What does it mean to do good? How do people arrive at their beliefs around good and bad? What explains the gaps between our beliefs in how to lead a good life and our behavior? What ought to be the role of work in a meaningful life?</p>
        <p>I'm very much in that sticky, gooey, removed-from-the-oven-early emerging adulthood phase of life. I'm definitely still learning -- help me find my way!</p>
