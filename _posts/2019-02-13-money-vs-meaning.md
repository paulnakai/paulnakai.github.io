The current state of work and my rosiest-glasses utopian daydream for the future.

As a 23-year-old who’s still looking ahead toward my murky career, I can’t escape the feeling that it comes down to choosing between money and meaning.

Let me clarify a few things and get rid of the pesky obvious objections. “Meaning” here refers to whatever is most objectively socially meaningful. Obviously, any individual can choose to find meaning in a myriad of ways, but I’m talking about a fundamental form of meaning that speaks to the essence of humanity. Put plainly, serving other people in a tangible way.

“But Paul, what about doctors?” Okay, (some) doctors are the exception to the rule. Great, now can we talk about work for the majority of people, those who are uninterested, unable, or unwilling to follow that path?

“If you don’t think you can be successful while pursuing meaningful work, you’re just not #hustling hard enough.” Nope. More workaholism isn’t the answer. Believe it or not, no matter how much the middle school english teacher “hustles,” they won’t suddenly be getting paid like consultants.

Now, I agree that it’s pretty gloomy and groundless to set this up as a total polarity. Most jobs do have at least a modicum of both. But would anyone disagree that it’s a general rule that you trade off money and meaning? Why else is job dissatisfaction so high? Why do we have bullshit jobs and others working shit jobs unable to pay their bills? This feels like it has more substantial grounds than just my naive unfamiliarity with the world.

How did we get here? And especially, why did we suddenly become so obsessed with “meaningful” work?

I do agree with the analysis that a weakening of community values and a decline in religious life has led to a vacuum for meaning, leading to a rise in the importance of workplace meaning. But I think there’s more: namely, the obsession with meaning is inextricably linked with the triumph of the *concept* of money over the *currency* of money.

Money is not a currency anymore. Money isn’t even a physical thing. 90%+ of our dealings with it take place virtually now (online banking, venmo, etc.). Isn’t it bizarre that a collection of pixels on a screen can signal so much? The digital era has brought a new level of abstraction to the concept of money. With this new abstraction, we have lost touch with the direct one-to-one transfer value of a certain amount of money and it instead represents some panacea, one-size-fits-all ultimate good.

This is to say: money is no longer a means to an end but an end in itself (I know, nothing groundbreaking). Before, money was exchanged for food, shelter, even consumption of nonessential goods like art, vacation, etc. It was a physical placeholder for other, truly meaningful goods: tasty food, a roof over our heads, pleasurable experiences.

Now, with most work as an end in itself, that mechanism is gone. We think of the value of physical pleasures and experiences in terms of their *worth* rather than their *meaning*. But this dissociation itself has generated the duality of money and meaning. Like any duality, the abstraction of money has necessarily led to the abstraction of the concept of meaning. There’s no good without bad, no yin without yang, no light without dark, no “money” without “meaning.” And thus, back when money carried less metaphysical weight, we had fewer existential crises.

I suppose the other significant puzzle piece is the state of capitalism today. Part of money’s detachment from meaning has been driven by the separation of capital and true productivity today. Capitalism is predicated on preventing this separation (i.e. that and only that which is socially meaningful generates profit), but I think we can all agree that fantasy is not our reality. Capital accrues in hand-wavy ways while productive labor is stomped upon.

I’m trying to avoid simply ranting about money madness here, but I will shake my fist at the world one last time.

In the war between my values for justice, equality, higher moral good and my instincts for self-preservation, greed, fear, who wins? With determination and courage, the former may win the war, but thousands of years of evolutionary history are cheering for team lizard brain. They’re going to win a lot of battles.

So, say idealistic young me decides to do healthcare or nonprofit work. I walk in with visions of serving the greater good… but eventually my day-to-day lifestyle concerns take over. The financial incentives that have invaded these sectors are warping otherwise beautiful, noble, worthy work:

Why should we eradicate disease when we [profit from it](https://aeon.co/essays/will-medicine-ever-recover-from-the-perverse-economics-of-drugs)?

If my nonprofit achieves its mission, then I guess it should dissolve? Then I would have to find a new job…

And so, these service industries (and others) are painted a noble hue but often ultimately pull their punches, intentionally or not. Noble goals might offer the sense of meaning that make a deathbed comfortable, but the less noble goals keep the wheels turning. Unfortunately, this is no contest in most head-to-head matchups. Inertia is powerful.

And this account only relates to the higher-ups in these industries, the decision makers. Everyone else in the trenches (the social worker, community organizer, etc.) clings on for as long as financially possible, but often must resort to trench-adjacent, more pragmatically comfortable but spiritually dampening jobs. Otherwise, labor — which does much of the obviously socially meaningful work — is increasingly squeezed, with little recourse other than, indeed, “hustling harder.”

This leaves plenty of well-intentioned people in a frustrating place, feeling helplessly stuck in a broken system. Must we resign ourselves to small victories where we can find them?

### Redesigning a better world

I am bursting with idealistic visions for how we might come to regard work in my lifetime. I’m not a total fool, I know this won’t happen easily. But in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, “nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” How will things ever get better if we never dream how they might?

Are power dynamics really that inevitable? Do we all end up jaded, corrupted at the first opportunity, or are we just stuck in familiar patterns? If we stop embracing the narrative of being stuck in a broken system, what might happen?

I hope to write much more about this, so I will simply offer a teaser here, but here’s the general schema:

We already live in a world with enough “productivity” that at least everyone in developed nations could live comfortably. There is much talk of the AI-assisted automated world we are coming into and the disruption to work we’ll see. Frustrations with inequality seem to be mounting. Let’s turn a new page, take a collective step forward, and create a world that bears out these thoughts:

What if we better understood that people don’t need to be compelled to work by pain of death, and that most everyone actually desires to be useful, productive, creative, to serve?

What if we realized that the world wouldn’t be so bad with a reasonable balance of work and play?

What if [leisure isn’t actually a bad word](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/) and it’s just our over-glorification of work that made it seem like one?

What if we all used leisure to spend more time with our families, build communities back up, eat meals together?

What if we embraced new social norms around balancing family and work across a lifetime that led to richer family lives and less burnout? What if we had policies that allowed for that?

<em>What if we were all able to make “work” work around our lives?</em>

What if we used our free time to collectively participate in academic surveys much more, unleashing the potential of legitimate, robust social science to further improve our lives?

What if we allowed ourselves to make more art? Who wouldn’t want more opportunities to pursue their “passions,” creative or otherwise?

What if we teach our children that we are cooperative creatures with some selfish tendencies rather than selfish creatures with some altruistic ones? What if we reexamined history to see that’s a much better explanation of humanity?

What if we turned the “war between my values for justice, equality, higher moral good and my instincts for self-preservation, greed, fear” that I bemoaned before into an alliance?

What if we embraced abundance mindsets rather than scarcity mindsets?

I believe in all of these possibilities for our world. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but we have to be aspirational if we want it to happen at all. The money-meaning duality is not fixed in nature. Our relationship with work is not fixed. I don’t believe that more leisure will just lead to more staring at our phones. Social media, video games, television won’t go away, but our need to consume them as a form of escapism can. We can build a world we don’t want to escape from. It’s already at our fingertips.
