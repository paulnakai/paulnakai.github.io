Why in-house yoga and financial weight loss incentives are not the answer.

Workplace wellness programs, as currently practiced, just don’t work. Why not? We can all get onboard with the underlying wisdom behind the idea of wellness: eat better, sleep better, exercise better, think better, and everything else will also improve. In fact, I think it’s safe to say that we each spend a good amount of our time and energy striving towards those goals. Why, then, are our employers’ efforts to aid in those goals not paying off?

It’s a problem of integrity. When your employer is offering you financial incentives to reduce your weight, stop smoking, or eat healthy foods, the flimsy veneer is: “we care about you!” But neither employer nor employee is actually fooled by that half-hearted message. The true motive behind most of these programs is cutting costs.

US per-capita healthcare expenditures are through the roof, and climbing. So when research is published in the prestigious Journal of Obvious Results declaring that happier and healthier employees have lower healthcare expenditures and are more productive, the light bulbs go off in the meeting rooms upstairs. Firms think, “how can I get my employees to be healthier so they don’t cost me so much?” and workplace yoga is born. And there’s the integrity problem. If both parties are fully aware that the true motive behind workplace wellness is cutting costs and increasing productivity, the colorful “we care about you!” branding is hollow, poor leadership. A principled corporate wellness initiative would be motivated by the question, “how can I get my employees to be healthier?” Full stop. Leave the financial analytics at home.

We all know that America struggles with healthcare. Unfortunately, we are conditioned to think of it primarily as a healthcare problem, not a health problem. As a financial problem, not a flourishing problem. And when we obsessively fixate on the former under the guise of addressing the latter, everyone loses.

Okay, that got my complaining out of the way. I know that criticizing is easy, so here’s where I offer my way forward: we need a radical recommitment to the fundamental form of wellness. Right now, wellness is a sticker we slap onto a broken body & mind in hopes that it mitigates some of the underlying illness. We need to flip that. Wellness should be the core state that withstands waves of illness.

What that means for the individual I’ll leave for another day. For now: what does that mean for the workplace?

For starters, actually getting to single-payer health insurance would probably help.

It means having company policies that make the “we care about you!” more than skin-deep. It means changing the fundamental motive behind company policy from “how can we squeeze every drop of productivity out of each worker?” to “how can we best take care of our employees?” There is a body language to company policy, and it speaks a lot louder than what’s on paper.

It means something like the [4-day workweek](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success) that’s been in the news thanks to New Zealand.

It means acknowledging that maybe people are unhappy because we’re paying them to work [bullshit jobs](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/) and pretending that there’s real value creation involved.

It means that we have to implement policies that reflect a fundamental value on human flourishing. We have to be bold enough to treat money as a means to that end, not the other way around, even when seemingly the whole world around us descends into profit madness. There are no shortcuts to truly valuing human life and worker wellness. People are savvier than you think. When a tech company offers unlimited paid vacation, there’s not one person who goes “wow, they really want me to be able to spend quality time away from work and focus on other priorities!” When a company in New Zealand makes the 4-day workweek mandatory, people can actually believe that.

And guess what? People will respond and grow. Most everyone in this country really does value work and wants to have a productive career. They want to work hard and get results. If we trust them to do that while also saying “I want you to live a healthy and fulfilling life” and *mean* it, we’ll see a lot more progress. We have to have faith that the extra efficiency will be there, that the costs will go down. We have to be willing to give in order to receive, even if it runs the risk of sacrificing a few shareholder pennies. Even though the NZ 4-day workweek example is but a small, glimmering example, its success dwarfs all the [twisted achievements](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0683) of corporate wellness in America today.

America is facing a health problem. Healthcare costs may be the simplest yardstick, but by focusing on this aspect of health, we reduce individual health to a financial optimization problem.

Call me a young idealist, but we live in an age of plenty, and I believe there’s plenty more worth striving for. Wellness ought not be measured by financial value. It has to be a human value. When we treat it as such, we’ll all get a lot more out of our Tuesday morning sun salutations.
