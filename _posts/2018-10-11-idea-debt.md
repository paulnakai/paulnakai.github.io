First off, I’m stealing this completely from [this article](https://lifehacker.com/dont-get-weighed-down-by-idea-debt-1828861275), so credit where credit is due. But I’m rehashing it because it’s a timely teaching for me right now.

“Idea debt” is a new way of conceptualizing the mechanism driving perfectionism. As the old adage goes, perfect is the enemy of good. But I love the concept of idea debt, because it illustrates *why* perfect is the enemy of good.

The common explanation here is that we fail to get things done because we’re too afraid to start for fear that they won’t be perfect. That certainly holds true for a lot of big, important projects. It’s why I’ve been talking about writing a musical for so long but have never even gotten around to finishing one song. That yet-to-be-written musical is a large part of why this concept is so resonant with me right now; I’m determined to just write the thing, even if it’s less than mediocre.

But there’s an entirely different class of goals that also suffer from idea debt and thus never get done. These are the more mundane projects that, frankly, we don’t actually care that much about getting perfect. The reason we don’t start these? Pure human laziness. The reason we never get around to them later? They reach a critical mass and we lose the flavor of motivation we had in the first place.

Case in point: I read this idea debt article the day it came out, over a month ago. Since then, I have had a note sitting on my laptop telling me to write the damn thing. It’s been a month. When was my peak enthusiasm? When I first read the article, and I managed to write about 30 words about it. Then when I hit the very first pause, the “what else do I have to say that’s actually coherent,” my brain, looking for the easy way out, decided to quit and leave the rest to Future Paul.

<em>I even tried to trick myself by putting it on the “this week” to-do list (I haven’t written the other two, either)</em>

I didn’t stop because I needed this article to be perfect. I stopped because my brain ran out of easy words to say about it, and rather than do the relatively effortful work of thinking up another cogent sentence, I probably got hungry or picked up my phone or thought about how I needed to take out the trash.

Why did I not start again for over a month? Because I’m *deep* in debt. My “things to write about” notepad has dozens of ideas, all that I found at one point pretty nifty. But I don’t own those ideas anymore. The Central Procrastinator’s Bank owns those ideas, and I got a terrible APR. If I had taken out a loan on only one of those ideas, I might’ve felt more compelled to pay it off more quickly. But, like anyone who passes that critical saturation point for debt, easy-way-out brain says “take the new credit card. Leave it to future you. Debt isn’t real.”

Sure, nothing’s real, pal. But idea debt weighs on you pretty much every waking moment of every day. Clearing my balance sheet by writing this article was only a drop in the bucket. I’ve still got that musical to write. And dozens of other medium posts to write.

So, what’s the takeaway? Again, robbing from the article. Remember, your life is short. Don’t put your half-baked dreams, large or tiny, on the shelf to collect dust. Your peak motivation is now, when you have the idea. Set it in motion. The only other way you’ll EVER get to doing the thing is if life gives you a big slap-in-the-face wakeup call. Those can be great, but here’s a metaphor for you: the most efficient way to drive a car is to maintain a steady pace. Not to idle forever and then suddenly floor it.

And, finally, the nice thing about idea debt compared to financial debt? You can just say “no.” Let go of little insignificant projects that are just weighing you down with debt. It’s impossibly difficult, but it’s so liberating. Your daily wellbeing will markedly improve. And **it’s only by eliminating the unimportant that we can clearly see what we care most deeply about**. You can’t get there by adding more and more to your plate. You have to be willing to take away.

And, crucially, by liquidating your assets and freeing yourself from debt, you will have more capacity to actually get things done as they come up. I’m infinitely more likely to write this blog post if there isn’t already a list of 30 ideas to pile it onto. I’m much more likely to write the musical if I’m not trying to write a book and hike the Appalachian trail at the same time (even though that would be *dope*).

But, Paul, since it’s so difficult to let go of even the mundane things since I still care about them (good point!), how will I know the difference between those and the essential ideas?

Answer: a while back, I discovered that Doritos makes a “russian roulette” version of their chips, where all the chips look the same but there are like 3 in the whole bag that are WORLD-ENDINGLY spicy. The rest can be so-so spicy. Naturally, I scoffed at this. I can handle my spice. My taste buds are macho. When eating this bag of chips, I kept coming across so-so spicy, and thinking “maybe these are them...”

Then I found the real deal, and I cried for a week. You’ll know when you know.
