I read [this article](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-to-be-happy.html) on The Cut about how college students aren’t happy (news flash) that broke down a happiness course at Yale which, among other things, attempted to tackle the two giants: time and money. Two commodities that tend to congeal into this amorphous blob monster that constantly evades your clutches, and if you do happen to grasp it, it points to the other side of the room at a sexier clone of itself, which then proceeds to scream “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?!” at you, at which point you let go and start chasing Sexy TimeMoneyMonster, rinse and repeat.

With that intro, here’s what the article made me think about. First, some background. The article points out that money is elastic: you could theoretically accumulate an infinite amount of it, and the amount that you do have can fluctuate. By contrast, time is inelastic: you can never accumulate more of it, and you’ve never had any less of it. By this reasoning, X time should be more valuable than X dollars, but often we don’t treat it this way. The article also points out that in the US, an abundance of money is a status symbol whereas an abundance of time is shameful, hence we put a premium on busyness. An A+ diagnosis of our dreadful cultural malady.

I want to introduce a third variable into the equation: effort. Basically, we value money over time because of the difference in effort. The value on money is given to us, requiring no effort; the value on time we have to create for ourselves.

Say I earn $15/hr. If the day were magically extended to 25 hours, and I had the choice of working that extra hour (earning $15 more) or treating it as completely “free” time, which should I pick? I’m sure we all salivate at the thought of having that extra hour a day (“I would finally start reading again!”)… but in practice, we pretty much all choose the $15. Why? An hour’s time can give me a really good conversation with a friend or a solid practice session with my musical instrument of choice. Or, it can give me slouching in a chair watching YouTube videos. I’d value the former way higher than $15 and certainly not the latter. But doing the former takes effort, opportunity, and luck. And even when I’m lazy and unlucky, $15 will always buy me 60 chicken nuggets from McDonalds.

The thought of having to exercise my agency to make sure every hour of my time is spent in a fulfilling way is extremely daunting. So it’s easier to opt out and take the 60 tasty nuggs and reduce the amount of time whose value we’re responsible for. Ask any high-achieving college student who comes back from a weeklong, unstructured vacation how they enjoyed their time. Their dis-ease is often palpable. Using all your time well is really, really hard.

Now, I’m not saying that working to earn money doesn’t require effort. But it doesn’t require the same kind of constantly-renewing effort that spending free time does. Going to work doesn’t require the same type of decision-making. Imagine if you had to be constantly job-searching the entirety of your 40+ year career. And I mean constantly. Not one day went by where you thought you had total job security. I’d say that’s a pretty fair comparison to the task of being completely financially secure but drowning in free time. Here’s an analogy: working is like being given a recipe for dinner every day that may take some serious energy to cook, but it’s a hell of a lot easier than the daily “what should we do for dinner tonight?” conundrum.

Okay, to break up the wall of text, here’s one of my favorite Dalai Lama quotes:
> What surprises me most is Man, because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he doesn’t enjoy the present; The result being he doesn’t live in the present or the future; He lives as if he’s never going to die, and then he dies having never really lived.

So here’s the fourth member of the time-money-effort mess: mortality. Our TimeMoneyMonster is getting real amorphous and blobby. Why are old people generally happier? Because time creeps back into reality and its value crystallizes; we may lose our physical hearing as we age, but that just frees up our sensitivity to the ticking of our internal clocks. 22-year-olds like me feel invincible: we think in terms of 5-year plans, and we’re never going to die, because we simply won’t exist by the time we’re meant to die. We’re going to be somebody else. Old people *are* going to die because their selves have congealed in a way.

Let’s put it this way: old people see the light at the end of the tunnel. Young people just see a bunch of different openings, no light involved. Middle-aged people are in this weird in-between where there are no tunnels, just an immeasurably large black hole (haha BURNED, existential-crisis middle-age folks!). If I had more time, I’d illustrate this analogy, and all of you (my imaginary fan base) would love it, but I’m busy munching on chicken nugget #53.

Here’s the other thing: time is *technically* an inelastic good. But our measurement of the value of time should not be inelastic, because our perception of time is not linear. We never experience time inelastically. You all know the Albert Einstein quote about time spent courting a nice girl versus sitting on a red-hot cinder.

Now, our perception of money is similarly fluid. Our value judgments on money are subjective, but *nowhere near what they’re like for time*. We’re explicitly asked to make value judgments on money all the time: what sort of salary do you want? How much do you want to spend on dinner? How much are you saving for retirement? Your kids’ college?

By contrast, we tend to make most of our value judgments on time implicitly; time’s value is confirmed negatively. We all do the things we “have to do,” and then we decide what to do in our remaining “free” time. We all constantly have thoughts of “I want to spend more time doing ____,” but that’s always in addition to the time we’ve already committed. There’s no resource we can go to that tells us how many hours it will cost us for some concrete deliverable of life meaning. Those are judgments we have to make for ourselves, and they’re both so impossible and frightening to definitively make that we often simply *don't* and instead just fumble around in the general direction of those goals. Now, I don’t meant to advocate against this approach, because I’m a big believer in the whole “journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” philosophy (wow I’m really hitting all the idioms today!), but I also believe that this approach more easily results in a devastating lack of intentionality and people waking up 30 years later realizing they never did the things they wanted to do.

This is hopefully only part 1 of my time vs. money thoughts, because I also have a lot of thinking-out-loud to do about Universal Basic Income, but I’ll leave this here for now. Let’s end on a fun linguistic note! We talk about having “free” time and how we “spend” that time, which begs the question: how can you spend something that has a value of $0?

Another idiom: there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Lunch costs $15, and it’s 60 chicken nuggets, so stop reading and get back to work, fool!
