title: "We're bad at pandemics because we're bad at large numbers"

In the early days of the Coronavirus outbreak, the US (among other countries) has been drastically too slow to respond. This is certainly true from a federal standpoint, but we’ll leave that discussion to others and focus on everyday people here. Experts are advising “social distancing” to slow the spread of the virus, and people are starting to take heed as events are being cancelled. However, all too many people are still interacting much more than they should. We simply don’t do a good job of internalizing how exponential growth works. We’ve all seen the squiggly line in math books, but any level of intellectual understanding does not easily translate to the moral, real-world decisions we now face.

As such, here are a few examples of exponential growth in pandemic terms. Before we dive in, I want to make something clear: I am not an epidemiologist. These numbers are not meant to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any way. They are only meant to say “if the disease behaved exactly in this way, this is what would happen.” Regardless, I think these are reasonable numbers to throw around given all the information actual experts have been able to give us so far. The scale is certainly on par with the pandemic that lies ahead of us.

So first, let’s look at the most textbook example of exponential growth. In pandemic terms, how many infections would we have after 10 days if (1) we started with one infected person and (2) each day, each infected person spreads the virus to one other person?

I say this is the most textbook case because it is a case of simple doubling of cases each day. One becomes two becomes four etc. As we see, after 10 days we end up with just over one thousand cases. Doesn’t sound too bad, right? 

Let’s compare this to the same time frame (10 days), still starting with just one infected person, but this time each person spreads the virus to *two* other people per day.

This time, after 10 days we have almost 60,000 cases. In other words, sixty times as many. And this comes from a difference of just one interaction per day. If you were an individual with the virus, you might not even notice the difference between one and two possible infections per day. In either case, you’re hardly interacting with anyone. But the difference is extreme over time.

Let’s scale it up even more to consider what we might call “normal” life. If your daily routine involves public transportation, or the occasional social event (movie theater, bar, house party, sporting event, etc.), or even just shopping and being around multiple people, you’re certainly interacting with more than 1 or 2 people per day.

(Again, for the sake of simplicity I use “interacting with” and “infecting” interchangeably here. An actual epidemiologist would take into account the rate of infection being less than 100% in any given close interaction. Still, for a highly contagious virus, it’s still likely quite high). 

Let’s consider the cases where each person interacts with 5 or 10 people per day, on average. Not a wild assumption in either case. Most people might call those scenarios normal life. In these cases, again starting with just a single infected person, how long would it take for us to reach 10 million cases?

<img src="/img/infection.gif" alt="Exponential growth, one infection/day" height="50%" width="50%" class="center-image">

In each case, we would reach 10 million cases in around a week. If we interact with only one or two people per day, we delay that exponential spike greatly.

This brings us to why the experts are urging “social distancing.” It’s not necessarily about stopping yourself from contracting the disease. It’s to stop that exponential spike from happening a week from now. It’s about spreading about possible hundreds of thousands or millions of cases over as much time as possible. If we go from 3,000 people needing hospital care to 300,000 people in a matter of days (which is how exponential growth can work), the system will be overloaded and many people will die preventable deaths.

There are many others who will share this exact message, so I will refrain from further inundation of the same message. Instead, I’ll finish with one more scenario to demonstrate exponential growth and how small differences in your interactions matter.

Let’s call “business as usual” 5 infections per person per day. If we all went about our lives as normal, this is a reasonable guess. (one more “Paul is not an epidemiologist” note: this is assuming we all have many novel interactions per day. After a few days, any given area will slow down in terms of “novel” interactions because most people you interact with will have interacted with someone else in your web of interactions, so over time your rate of transmission will go down. But we’re ignoring that for these projections, as this is about pure exponential growth not true epidemiological modeling). Let’s call “social distancing” 1 infection per day. 

Again, starting from a single infection, 5 days of “business as usual” leads us to 7,776 cases. A relatively small number in the scheme of the total US population, right? Now, what do you think happens after 5 more days of “business as usual” vs. 5 more days of “social distancing?” How extreme will the difference be?

Before we see the answer, if you’re unfamiliar with exponential growth and you want to check my math, this link provides a helpful guide. 

Here we go. 5 days of business as usual gives us 7,776 cases. If those 7,776 people (along with everyone else) start to socially distance and limit their infection rate to 1 per day, we end up with about 250,000 cases after 5 more days. This is still a pretty large number. There’s a good chance you would know someone who got sick, maybe several someones, maybe some of them would die.

But if we continue with business as usual we end up with 60 million sick. After just 10 days. 5 days in, we had fewer than 8,000 sick. 5 days later we end up with 1/5 of the entire US population sick. Millions could die as the healthcare system is overwhelmed. Your grandma who needs routine hospital care could die even if she doesn’t get sick. 

This is why everything seems alarmist, even though we currently have very few (known) cases in the US. If we carry on as usual, a handful of cases can balloon to thousands or millions seemingly overnight. Keep in mind that many people don’t show symptoms, especially young people (who are most likely to be out and about socializing).

One last thing: while the spread of the virus can grow exponentially, the rate that we can test will not. Test kits and doctors don’t duplicate overnight. This means that the number of “confirmed cases” will severely lag behind the actual number of cases. So don’t take the official reported numbers as gospel.

I’ll finish with one last plea added to the chorus of voices. You young people: stop going out. This isn’t about your personal appetite for risk. This is about your willingness to endanger others. Obviously, do what is essential for your own wellbeing. But really scrutinize what “essential” means. Every time you interact with others, think about the increased risk of you infecting others and ultimately killing the vulnerable, not about whether you will get sick or not. 

Sorry for the doom and gloom. I know we all need some sunshine, and this type of proselytizing will get very draining very quickly. But I hope we all take some time to consider how exponential growth operates, contrary to our intuition, and to understand that there are very real difference between orders of magnitude here. Stay home!
