The short answer: not as often as you’d like to think.

Rather, if you focus on doing good, you might come to realize you do quite well (in a more comprehensive sense). But if you focus on doing well, you’re probably not doing as much good as you think. To understand why, read Anand Giridharadas’s new book [Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539747/winners-take-all-by-anand-giridharadas/9780451493248/). This week, I attended a book launch of his, which brought me here. I will refrain from summarizing the book here, but I cannot recommend it highly enough. Instead, I will start from the same puzzle the book does, and offer my own reflection.

The puzzle: how do we make sense of these two seemingly contradictory truths of the current era?

1. Our elite class is the most generous in history (see chapter 2 of the [US trust study of high net worth philanthropy](https://www.ustrust.com/publish/content/application/pdf/GWMOL/USTp_ARMCGDN7_oct_2017.pdf)).
2. [Economic inequality is staggering and worsening](https://www.businessinsider.com/income-inequality-highest-united-states-2018-8).

You could dispute truth #1. You could point out that giving by the rich as a percentage of income has remained constant or decreased, despite the increasing total amount of dollars donated. But this elite class sure does a lot more than the aristocracies of yore. And the private sector is rife with talk of social impact, of corporate social responsibility, of “changing the world,” much more than any private sector we’ve ever seen before.

But you can’t dispute truth #2. The cold, hard fact remains that the rich are getting richer a hell of a lot faster than the poor are. This is not a “rising tide lifts all boats” situation. The tide is catapulting the yachts and flooding everyone else.

To complement Anand’s story of why this is the case, I want to flesh out the story he tells in chapter 2 of his book: the story of the well-meaning elite college grad.

***

I am one of those well-meaning elite college grads. And, like many young people, my peers and I have been trapped in this ongoing existential prison of wondering what to do with our lives, what career path to follow.

I have been privy to the seductive pitch of the consulting firm: that I can spend a couple years building highly transferable skills and connections, exponentially multiplying my future ability to have an impact all while padding my paycheck quite nicely. In Anand’s words, it’s a win-win. Pay off any student debt, surround yourself with the smartest colleagues who will push you to be the best you can possibly be, opening up every door you could possibly want open. And you won’t even have to descend into evil to do it, like those Wall Street yuppies! You’ll be optimizing businesses, social enterprises, even the nonprofit sector, doing some real good for some real folks! Similarly appetizing pitches came from the tech companies of Silicon Valley.

And, lo and behold, [50% of my graduating class got their first jobs out of college in tech, consulting, or finance](https://beam.stanford.edu/about-us/stanford-destinations).

Why? “I’ll get to solve cool problems and have a lot of impact” and “it’s not about the money” are the near-universal explanations given. There were a sizable handful that joked about selling out, or even selling their souls, but the vast majority sincerely believed that this was the optimal path for their own fulfillment as well as making some sort of positive impact on the world.

It’s pretty clear how this is a microcosm of the puzzle of truths #1 and #2. These college students are young, idealistic, and generous of spirit, and yet they’re going on to work for or start companies that generate enormous profits. Silicon Valley preaches value creation over extraction, but anyone who’s ever walked down the streets of SF can tell you that [rings pretty hollow](https://mic.com/articles/131861/silicon-valley-is-lying-to-you-about-economic-inequality#.rNyYoofX6).

I was not part of this 50%, but across my four years of undergrad and continuing forward, the pull of that path and that message remains very strong. But resistance is so crucial. Because this moment — the moment that 50% of the nation’s top graduates accept those tech, consulting, and finance job offers — is a major inflection point, a point of almost-no-return that inevitably follows to our puzzle: a generous wealthy class and a gutted working class.

In other words, this seems like one of the last major opportunities to right the ship. Why? Inertia and loss aversion. Once young people get started down any path, it’s increasingly difficult for them to change directions. Add a hefty salary into the mix, and it becomes laughably unlikely that these new grads will switch paths down the line if it will cut their salary in half.

The overwhelming majority of those 50% will stay in similar industries and move into the elite class. They will make a lot of money, keep chugging along, ignore the subtle voice in their heads saying something’s not right, have their midlife crises and start to feel like it’s too late to start over, make up for it as much as they can by “giving back” and fruitlessly warning the other generations to not follow in their footsteps. Other narratives exist that involve less angst and more individualistic values, but very few that end with moving the needle on inequality.

Rather than continue to characterize this budding elite class in such a hostile tone, I want to offer a more removed diagnosis of why this trend continues, and hopefully land on some solutions for moving forward.

Let’s dive into the psyche of the elite college student, those at the Ivy+ institutions (warning: the following claims are opinions, not scientific fact).

These kids, like every other kid in the American school system, started school before they had any sort of real-human consciousness. From the earliest possible age, we started learning our shapes, our numbers; later, our history, our literature. And at many stages of this educational journey, some kids would raise their hand, and ask, “why, teacher?” And we never really get a satisfying answer for that. It’s tough to say why learning those shapes matter, why learning the Pythagorean theorem matters, why learning about ancient civilization matters, etc.

Part of the answer to the “why” question is a genuine deception: it actually doesn’t. Some things we just learn to fill the space of 15 years of mandatory schooling. But a large percentage of what we learn in school really does matter, it’s just really hard to get that across to a kid embroiled in the throes of puberty.

So, these kids are gradually trained to just put their heads down, get the work done, and get as good as possible at optimizing the “what” instead of worrying about the “why.”

Now, for these Ivy+ kids, add to the mix that they’re constantly receiving this feedback: you’re smart! You’re good at this! You’re going to do amazing things!

That sort of praise feels good. Why wouldn’t these kids just keep on doing the the things that are earning them praise? Hence: doubling down on solving the task at hand without a second thought for why it matters.

Now, I don’t mean to imply that students are amoral robots who are just really good at doing what they’re told. But it’s important to acknowledge the power of social conditioning, and to understand how people in general follow the path of least resistance.

My point here is basically that we need to acknowledge that high-achieving students love to solve problems — the type of problem you can find in a textbook. Over the years we’ve been conditioned to feel most rewarded by problems that have measurable outcomes. 4x + 3 = 15, find x; here’s this share price over the last 6 months, what will it be tomorrow; write an algorithm that will tell people which shoes they should buy. The surface “why” is obvious for these: get the right answer, make your teacher/boss happy, help the company reach its goals.

But the “why not” is more important to understand. For the classroom, the consequences are obvious: get a bad grade. In the real world, they’re less obvious, but can be much more sinister. It’s really murky to trace how profit-making ventures can result in social harm. And I know “capitalism is evil” is not a thorough or convincing argument. For that, read Anand’s book, or read other literature to learn who capitalism serves and who it harms. There’s a lot more to say there than I can go into here, but here’s my one-sentence take: these high-powered bastions of modern capitalism (tech, finance, consulting) have become hyper-rationalized, gamifying the process, turning people into statistics, making them easier to ignore in the optimization game. I think it’s fair to say that the neoliberal ideology driving our society today benefits the powerful at the expense of the rest.

In sum:

* Our education system does a better job of training people to solve analytical “what/how to do” problems than ethical “why or why not” problems because that’s what the economy rewards.
* In particular, we do our “smart” kids a disservice by building their entire identities and reward systems around achievement because it makes them seek that achievement as the only valuable end.

Borrowing Hannah Arendt’s idea of the banality of evil: it’s not that all the young people going into tech, finance, and consulting aren’t capable of moral reasoning. It’s not fair to say that most of them have more selfish values than pro-social ones. I believe that most of these grads have genuine idealism (though some might claim a “realistic” idealism) and believe in some social purpose of their choices. It’s just that they’ve learned to conflate the joy of solving a problem — any problem — with moral goodness. If I solve a problem, it feels good. Doing good for others also makes me feel good. So, it’s hard for me to distinguish between solving the types of problems I come across in consulting or tech and actually doing good. The feedback system is built for this conflation, and the cynic in me would argue that those most responsible for designing the system added this feature intentionally as a way of “trapping” young, smart idealists.

What comes out of all of this? I’ll parrot back the advice Anand gave at the book launch, and embellish a bit: start with the end in mind. Imagine the world you want to live in, the world you want to leave behind. What’s different from the world we live in today? Who has access to what? Then work backwards: how do we get there? How can I contribute? How did people make similar changes in the past? Basically, live a life consistent with your values and beliefs. Life is short, and it will feel shorter if you trap yourself in the myopia of “I‘ll focus on money and ‘problem-solving’ and worry about the rest later.” Just a short time spent in this willful ignorance can lead to a life of perpetual agitation, of increasing unwillingness to look truth in the eye, and ultimately, self-righteous indignation when you’re rightfully accused of becoming someone you never meant to be.

I feel a little gross for coming across as preachy and judgy. This is a topic I feel strongly about, and I don’t mean to criticize any individual’s choices. Painting with a broad brush in this way cannot capture any individual’s experience and the whole context of their behavior. But I speak forcefully because this feels like an urgent problem to me. I care a lot about seeing a more equitable world. A just world, that places human values above economic ones (within reason. I’m not *that* naive). I believe that world is possible. And I think it’s so vital for young people to support each other and encourage each other to be courageous, to fight for that world, rather than give in to cynicism. Like everything else, if you don’t do it now, will you ever?
