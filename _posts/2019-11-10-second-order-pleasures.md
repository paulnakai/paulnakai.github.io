Work in progress. 

Illustration: Eisenhower matrix-type thing.

What things do I enjoy that I enjoy,
enjoy that I don't enjoy,
don't enjoy that I enjoy,
don't enjoy that I don't enjoy?

To me, second-order pleasures line up with how I view myself. If you say to yourself, "I am a person that ____," your second-order pleasures reflect your answers. They reflect your aspirations, but also your self-ascribed identity.

Examples for me:

I enjoy that I enjoy
-exercising
-music

I enjoy that I don't enjoy
-using substances

I don't enjoy that I enjoy
-videogames

I don't enjoy that I don't enjoy
