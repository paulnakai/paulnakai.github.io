title: "Second-order pleasures: who we choose to be, not default to be"

I like lying in bed in the mornings. But do I *like* that I like lying in bed in the morning? No. Our second-order pleasures — our like-that-I-likes (or in this case, don't-like-that-I-like) — are important to understand. We may not have much control over how much we enjoy ice cream or exercise, but we can aspire to like them more or less. Those aspirations, not our basic dopamine response, best define who we are.

At least, I found this model personally informative. Second-order pleasures line up with how I view myself. If you say to yourself, "I am a person that ____," your second-order pleasures reflect your answers better than your basic pleasures do. Here are some of my second-order pleasures and displeasures to explain what I mean.

**I enjoy that I enjoy** exercising. Or rather, I enjoy that I've habituated this enough that I consider it part of my identity. I feel most like myself when I'm in a consistent exercise routine, which usually consists of swimming, biking, and running these days. I also enjoy that I enjoy making music. I'm a musician! Again, this becomes an identity rather than just an activity due to the added layer of pleasure.

There are things that **I enjoy that I don't enjoy**. These are interesting, because even though these activities don't bring me joy, I do get some sense of joy or fulfillment out of my relationship with these activities because of the second-order pleasure I get from *not* enjoying them.

+ Using substances. I've outgrown my judgmental phase of people who use substances, but I'm glad that I don't. While I do enjoy the occasional alcoholic drink, I wouldn't say that I "drink." And I certainly never do anything more illicit/serious than that. Again, this has become part of my identity: I am someone who doesn't use substances.
+ Bingeing TV/movies (that much). Again, not to judge those who have this vice, but I'm *so* glad that I don't. I certainly have my vices that are just as much of a time-suck (see videogames below), but TV never caught on. That said, I do try to avoid watching new shows because occasionally one will suck me in and then I will watch it all. But I'll almost never binge in this case; at most, I'd watch 3-4 episodes a day.

Now for the second-order displeasures. To use this framework, what we commonly call vices are those things that you **enjoy but you don't enjoy that you enjoy**. Those behaviors you're trying to curb but you just keep coming back to. This category is the one people most mistakenly label as displeasures. If you keep coming back to the behavior, that means you enjoy it (by the typical definition of pleasures as things we seek out and pains we avoid). But that doesn't mean that you enjoy that you enjoy it. 

+ My main vice: videogames. This is my biggest vice in the category of "indirectly harmful through opportunity cost." I don't find it actively that bad for me, like smoking or drinking might be for example. But I'd say I only get value out of about 30 minutes of videogames per day (on average); after that, I always end up wishing I had spent that extra time reading, with friends, sleeping, or pretty much anything else. I'm very streaky with this: I'll have good streaks where I hardly play games, and then bad streaks where I play waaaaay too much. Working on it!
+ Social media. This one is probably at least a little bit true for most people these days. Again, I would wager most people (myself included) wouldn't say that "enjoy" social media too much, but can't seem to stop using it. Thus, it counts as a pleasure in my book but a second-order displeasure. I'm doing pretty okay these days with social media. I still have an automatic response to open it up when I'm bored, but I don't usually stay hooked in and scrolling for long periods of time. 

The final category: the things **I don't enjoy that I don't enjoy.** This one is interesting, I'm sure there are other activites that fall into this category that I'm eager to reflect on. Again, to think in terms of identity, these are things you might say "I wish I was someone who..." about. 

+ "Going out." I enjoy the occasional night out on the town with good friends, but no one would describe me as someone who enjoys going out. Partly, I do enjoy this, if only for saving money. But I do wish I were a little more free-spirited about this sort of thing, that I got a little more out of just being in public around strangers. In a way, this is saying "this is one introverted quality I don't enjoy<sup>2</sup>." I do enjoy<sup>2</sup> most of my other introversions.
