Common wisdom says that a personal website is a huge opportunity to demonstrate your skills, get detailed on your niche, and generally maximize your employability. I've been conflicted about this because I'm still building my skills, figuring out my niche, and I instinctively hate the words "employability," "self-marketing", and "personal branding." The first two sources of conflict will go away, but the final one won't. I hate those words, and you should too. At least, you shouldn't have to love them.

I think the common wisdom is symptomatic of some problematic patterns that I don't want to encourage. Thus, my website: a lead-by-example model of how we might present ourselves in a world with better incentives.

(PS... This does NOT mean that I'm not working on my skills, my niche, and my employability.)

## The world today vs. the world to aim for

*Preface: the following criticisms are directed at the conditions and incentives individuals face, not the desires and values of individuals themselves. Getting from "the world today" to "the world to aim for" does not require changing individual human nature, just which aspects of human nature we encourage and discourage. This is a macro-level criticism of the traps that many of us find ourselves unfortunately stuck in.*

In the world today, work is regarded as the supreme source of validity and respect. We define work narrowly and identify ourselves chiefly by the way we are paid. We accept as gospel the ideology that humans are innately selfish and societies must accept that or risk collapse. We collectively agree that the best way to motivate members of society to contribute is money: the carrots of consumerism and the sticks of eviscerating the poor.

In the world to aim for, we recognize that from an early age, we are all motivated to help one another. We recognize that our answers to "if I didn't I have to worry about money, I'd..." reflect diverse desires for care, beauty, community, and justice. We agree that curiosity, self-improvement, and the joy of lifting others up are universal human experiences when nurtured. We are more thoughtful about the differences between fixed human nature and human behavior under different incentives and environmental conditions. 

In the world today, we operate under the assumption of scarcity. As individuals and as groups, we spend the vast majority of our time simply ensuring that the wheels can keep turning. The message of scarcity is deeply ingrained both by our evolutionary history and modern social systems. All are afflicted, from the truly destitute to even the 1%. At the same time, the information economy is driving all costs of production to zero and our economic systems are struggling to adapt.

In the world to aim for, we operate under the assumption of abundance. We are able to leverage technology to provide for more and more basic needs, opening up vastly more man-hours for other purposes. This has been the story of all human history, but we are now at or near the point where the resources essential to survival are abundant. We choose to allocate those resources in a way that brings us closer to living our ideals of liberty, equality, and the pursuit of happiness. We are more trusting of people who don't resemble us, believing that they deserve the extra benefits and will use them well.

In the world today, we have the internet and its attendant technologies. The internet has vastly multiplied the ways you can earn money. Gone are the confines of the brick-and-mortar; now, in the attention economy, every moment is monetizable. Others have provided a blueprint for profiting from your hobbies, your sense of humor, and your entire online self. We lionize the "hustlers" and the influencer is the new self-made man. But the internet and globalization means that you're competing with everyone else for monetized attention. The formula is simple, but you have to be the needle in the haystack. If you're not always getting ahead, you're falling behind.

In the world to aim for, we feel more comfortable with a more authentic presentation of our online self. This means vulnerabilities, less polish, and most of all, not participating in the race to the bottom of the attention economy. We are better equipped to differentiate online reality and online truth from lived reality and lived truth. We don't have to rely on our online self for opportunities and satisfaction. 

***

Ultimately, the world to aim for requires a significant overhaul to our economic, political, and social systems. We need a redesign to affirm the value inherent in a human, allow new models to be economically viable, glorify leisure and even tolerate freeloading. We need to move towards eliminating the fear of scarcity. If we are able to eliminate the fear of scarcity and reduce incentives toward greed, what will people do?

I know this proselytizing could be deemed optimistic, idealistic, or simply out of touch. But I am an idealist not because I believe that it is *likely* that this better world will happen but since I believe it is *possible* we must aim for it.

So, common wisdom dictates how to make a website for the world today. In my case, this website reflects what I hope people might share in the world to aim for. I choose to share who I am, not the reduced version of myself that solely illustrates my market value. I hope you agree that there is still value here for the world today, not just for an idealized fantasyland. The website itself is not the point, since it's pretty low stakes. But it happens to be an opportunity for me to plant a flag in the ground, so here it is!
