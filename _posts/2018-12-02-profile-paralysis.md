Is it possible to represent yourself authentically online? I used to think so. Now, I’m not so sure.

<em>My bold rebellion against the perfectly-manicured online self. This is my big statement piece. Really makes you think, doesn’t it?</em>

Ooh, what an edgy intro. Good timing, a healthy dose of gravitas but without being stuffy. The perfect opening. There’s only one problem: it feels fake.

On the one hand, writing is a construction, and good writing goes through several iterations before finding its final form. So, one might argue that better writing should be more refined and less “natural”, more white bread than whole wheat.

But in this case, writing a blog post, it’s not about “writing.” It’s about some spectacle of sharing myself, my innermost thoughts, as publicly as possible so I may finally be recognized for my brilliance, my singular genius; so people can go, “where has this guy been this whole time?!” and I achieve lasting happiness and fulfillment. As much as I try to insist to myself that’s not the case, there’s no escaping it, for me or anyone else. For the everyday person, there’s no such thing as expressing ideas online anymore. All expression is self-expression; all self-expression is self-creation.

[This post](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/11/27/toward-a-more-radical-selfie/) puts it perfectly:

> “The collapse of the critical space between one’s personality and one’s online persona erases the distinction between self-expression and self-promotion. Every post now seems to fall into a dangerous trap.”

Nailed it. But what brought about this collapse? I’m starting to think that it’s never been possible to share an authentic self online. But before, we didn’t care. We all implicitly understood the gap between our online personas and our real selves. No one was trying to cultivate a self online, to discover their authentic voice (known today as your personal brand, because authenticity can’t be monetized). We were online because it was novel, it was amazing, it was exciting. But it also wasn’t real.

It’s sure real now. The internet has evolved. The rise in digital self-expression has been accompanied by a precipitous drop in real world self-creation. I won’t continue into a harangue against the internet, that’s a tired line, but *still*.

Instead, I want to point out something I’m calling “profile paralysis.” The term is meant to capture the newfound territory in social media where there’s widespread aversion to posting (unless it’s in temporary form, like Instagram live). Now, I don’t know if anyone else feels like this is a thing, but I frequently find myself pondering this shift. I used to post multiple song lyrics a day to Facebook. People’s Instagram feeds used to look like grainy, over-filtered messes of the hodgepodge of daily life, not a professional photo shoot carefully workshopped before going public.

And the change isn’t simply a matter of us all growing up. Something else has happened: the stakes have been raised for online participation. Precisely because that critical space between true personality and online persona has collapsed. We can’t share anything online now without it defining us, so we resort to not sharing anything at all. We skulk on the sidelines of social media, still spending a vast amount of our time on it, time that otherwise might be spent in the real world creating real experiences, but less and less willing to participate digitally. Profile paralysis.

I don’t have anything else to say besides this: it’s a darn shame. I think the pursuit of authenticity is one of the most valuable pursuits in life. In all arenas, whatever authenticity means — essence, honesty, integrity, truth, humility — it shall always bear the juiciest fruit. In many cases, authenticity is simple, even if it’s hard. But I don’t see a simple path for me to be authentic online, though it burns me to say it.

I want to be able to post whatever random things to Instagram, to Facebook. It’s not fear of being judged that holds my hand (thank god I’ve grown out of that phase). It’s aversion to the self-promotion and creation of a “personal brand” that is inextricable from online participation now. It’s a fear of being caricatured by my own doing, no matter how hard I try to avoid it.

***

Something else has to be around the corner. Because the well of online participation is starting to dry up. And, as in the desert, those that survive will undergo extreme mutations to survive the harsh conditions. Deep meme culture, “influencers,” whatever else that I’m already too old to catch, these entities dominate the online social landscape. They’re all a far cry from an authentic self. But, for now, they’re the most comforting, recognizable online presence we have. That doesn’t mean they can and should suffice. What’s next?
