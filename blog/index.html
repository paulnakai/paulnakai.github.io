<p> I started writing on Medium before I built this website, so the first posts below are reposted from there. I may continue to cross-post.</p>
<p> I tend to write mostly op-ed style think pieces rather than instructive posts. The style ranges in formality depending on my mood and the subject matter. I write about humanistic values, the future of work, ethics, justice, meaning, the trials of your (my) 20s.
