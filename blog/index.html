    <p> I started writing on Medium before I built this website, so the first posts below are reposted from there. I may continue to cross-post.</p>
    <p> I tend to write mostly op-ed style think pieces rather than instructive posts. The style ranges in formality depending on my mood and the subject matter. I write about humanistic values, the future of work, ethics, justice, meaning, the trials of your (my) 20s.
	<ul class="posts">

	  {% for post in site.posts %}
	    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
